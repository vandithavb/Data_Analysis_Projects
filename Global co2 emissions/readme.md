# Global CO₂ Emissions Visualization

This project provides an interactive Tableau visualization to analyze global CO₂ emissions per capita across various regions and countries. The dashboard highlights emission trends, enabling users to explore and compare data over time and across geographical locations. 

You can explore the interactive visualization directly on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/vanditha.vijayakumar.babu/viz/GlobalCO2Emissions_17298787123820/GlobalCO2Emissions).

## Project Overview

The "Global CO₂ Emissions" visualization presents:
- Emission trends over the years, segmented by country and region.
- Per capita emissions, allowing for meaningful comparisons between nations.
- Regional insights, showcasing how different parts of the world contribute to CO₂ emissions.

## Key Features

- **Interactivity**: Hover and filter options allow users to explore data by year, region, and country.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Easy comparisons between countries and regions to understand emission patterns.
- **Visual Insights**: Engaging visuals that highlight high-emission regions and changes over time.

## Skills and Tools

- **Tableau**: Developed the visualization using Tableau for interactive data exploration.
- **Data Analysis**: Conducted data cleaning and analysis to prepare the dataset for visualization.
- **Data Source**: The dataset includes historical CO₂ emission records from global data repositories.


## Future Improvements

- Adding more detailed filters for specific sectors or sources of emissions.
- Incorporating projections for future emission trends based on current data.
