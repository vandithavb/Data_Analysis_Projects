## Welcome to My Data Journey ðŸš€

As a passionate data enthusiast, I believe that data holds the key to unlocking the worldâ€™s most fascinating stories. This repository is a growing collection of my data analysis projects, where I explore real-world datasets to uncover insights, solve problems, and turn raw data into impactful decisions. Whether youâ€™re just starting out or deeply invested in data, I hope these projects inspire you as much as theyâ€™ve inspired me.

## Project List
Here's a list of the current projects included in this repository:

1. **[Movie Data Correlation Analysis](https://github.com/vandithavb/Data_Analysis_Projects/tree/main/Movie%20Data%20Correlation%20Analysis):**
   - Performed data analysis on a Kaggle movie dataset to identify significant correlations and trends. Processed data, calculated correlations, and visualized insights using scatter plots and heatmaps.
   - Tools: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook


## Tools & Technologies
Each project leverages a variety of modern tools and technologies for comprehensive data analysis and visualization:

- **Programming Languages:** Python, R
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Visualization:** Tableau, Power BI
- **Data Processing:** SQL, Excel

## Structure
Each project has its own folder, and inside, youâ€™ll find:

- **README.md:** A full breakdown of the project, the dataset used, and key insights.
- **Data Files:** Relevant datasets for the analysis.
- **Scripts/Notebooks:** Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks containing the data analysis code.

## How to Run
For each project:
1. Navigate to the specific project folder.
2. Follow the instructions provided in the projectâ€™s `README.md` file.
3. Install the required libraries as mentioned in the respective project files.

## Why This Matters
I believe in the transformative power of data. These projects not only serve as examples of my technical skills but also reflect my curiosity and drive to solve real-world problems using data. With every analysis, I aim to push the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible and deliver insights that can shape better decisions.
